# Try to think Differrent (by thinhnp6)

Everyone has a place called home to return. On the internet, that place is our own homepage. 

## Problem

With that comparison, what should our homepage have in term of content ?
- Obviously, self-introduction, personal social media, telling the audience what they need to know about us
- Personal Blog: Topic can be varied, can be serious, educational, or hilarious - which function as the building block for our audience to have a comprehesive look about us
- Personal Project, Shared Experience to building credibility to our audience
- Little tweaks and functionalities: For example, tagging system to help reader finding blogs with similar topic.

## Solution

Our homepage is using Static Web, why is that ? Comparing Static Web with Dynamic Web, we can see both their pros and cons:

- Dynamic Web: 
    + Pro: Extensive configuration both in styling, updating contents and interacting with our audience
    + Con: Relatively time-consuming in building and maintaining project; Trouble in effciency and loading time 
 
- Static Web:
    + Pro: Quick to build and deploy with template. Resource Effcient while having Minimal Loading time.
    + Con: Doesn't scale great when we have more and more resource to handle 

Since the scope of our problem is personal homepage, we should keep our project at the simple level and using static web approach to streamline the process.
