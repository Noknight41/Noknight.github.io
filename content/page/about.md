Yeah, it's a bit corny but hey, why not ?
My name is Nguyen Phuc Thinh, I'm currently a third-year software engineering student in Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

- I'm learning to get bachelor's degree in Computer Science at HCMUT
- I love exploring and exploiting new knowledge, I do like reading book but never finish them.
- I love learning Japanese and learning about Japan's Culture.
- I grew up in very awesome and supportive family

This month (05/2022), I have started my first position as a Software Development Fresher at ZaloPay - a leading Vietnamese e-wallet service - and I'm very happy to share this.

### My History

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so you can also look at a more extensive [resume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) if you're interested and it will answer **most** your questions.
