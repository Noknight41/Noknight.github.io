Yeah, it's a bit corny but hey, why not ?
My name is Nguyen Phuc Thinh. I have the following qualities:

- I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at HCMUT
- I love exploring and exploiting new knowledge
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- I'm a gamer 

What else do you need?

### My History

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so you can also look at a more extensive [resume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) if you're interested and it will answer **most** your questions.
